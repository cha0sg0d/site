Memz is designed to _never_ collect any personally identifiable or sensitive information. Every image and caption that is stored on our server cannot be read by us or a third party because the data is end to end encrypted. We use additional layers of authentication and security to provide an even stronger guarantee that you control who sees your Memz. Our [Terms of Service](#terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy) are below.

## Terms of Service

If you use our website, you agree to our privacy policy.

Don’t try to gain or gain unauthorized access to our services.

The link to your game contains a unique key (ex: `memz.party/5c934/#<unique_key>`) that is never sent to our server. That key is used for encrypting and decrypting the images and captions submitted in the game. Anyone who has access to the game link can view your images.

You are responsible for managing access to the link to your game. We can never view your images, but we can’t help if you send the link to the wrong person and your Memz are leaked.

## Privacy Policy

### Data We Collect

**Game Data**

For the purposes of playing a game of Memz, we collect the following information:

1. Game data, such as usernames, start time, and game status.
2. Images from your personal device
3. Captions for images

The images and captions are end to end encrypted. This means that the only people who can view the data are at the “ends” of the communication: The user submitting the image or caption and the user(s) receiving the image or caption.

Game data is not encrypted, but access is protected by a cryptographically secure access token.

There are two scenarios in which this data can be exposed:

1. If our servers are hacked.

If all our data is exposed, the only information an attacker will gain is the usernames of players. They cannot decrypt images or captions without the private key that is only known by the users.

2. A user sends the link to their game room to a malicious actor.

This would expose the specific images and captions for that game room, but cannot decrypt data for any other game room. It is the users’ responsibility to ensure that only approved participants receive the game room link.

**Analytics**

For the purposes of measuring usage and improving our product, we use [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics). Plausible is a privacy-focused service that does not collect personally identifiable information or cookies, making it GDPR-compliant out of the box. You can opt out of Plausible Analytics by following the instructions [here](https://plausible.io/docs/excluding-localstorage#to-exclude-your-visits-from-being-counted).

**Public Memz**

For the purposes of a community collection of Memz, we collect Memz that users choose to send us. These Memz are not encrypted, as the user consents to them being publicly viewable by sending us their finished product.

**Push Notifications**

Users can opt in to Push Notifications which use a third party delivery service such as Google Cloud Messaging or the Apple Push Notification Service to send updates about the game state. We store the unique subscription urls that are used for sending these messages, and delete them when a user unsubscribes.

## How We Use Your Data

**Game Data**

We use this data to make the game work! Users submit images and captions for those images and choose their favorites.

**Analytics Data**

We use this data to determine the effectiveness of our distribution, marketing and new features. This data is not personally identifiable, it just gives us an aggregate picture of where users are coming from.

**Public Memz**

We use this data to add a “Greatest Hits” section to our website. If users choose to do so, they can send us their finished Memz which will knowingly be shared with others.

**Push Notifications**

We use this to alert users when important actions have occurred in the game. Users can unsubscribe from push notifications at any time.

## How We Share Your Data

We don’t have any personally identifiable information to share and we don’t share any other information with third parties either.

We analyze the data collected above for internal purposes to see how our product is being used. For example, we might look at the Plausible Analytics dashboard to see how many visits our website received or we might look at our database to see how many games of Memz were played today.

## Your Choices and Obligations

### Choices

**Do you want notifications?**

Opt in or out via the game menu. Currently only available for Chrome and Android devices.

**Do you want to send us your Memz for a public collection?**

You may choose to do so when your game is over. Be careful, once you send us the image, it can be viewable by people who did not participate in your game.

**Do you want to clear the data stored in your browser?**

If you want to cut down on storage space, you can clear your game data via the game menu. You can also clear the data through browser-level storage management options.

### Obligations

**Protect your game room link**

If anyone gets your game room link who you don’t want to have it, they can view all of the images and captions for that game. Be careful with you send the link to. We, the developers, cannot view your data, but anyone with the link can.
